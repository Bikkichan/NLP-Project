At Bellroy, we believe in balance. Art + science. Design + data. Intuition + technology. We are proud of the products we put out into the world, and like to know that they are being supported as best they can by all parts of the business. As our Logistics Analyst, you'll keep a close eye on our digital marketplaces, so we can continue to sell and distribute our products all over the world with great effectiveness. Working closely with our production and operations teams, you'll help to manage our stock levels and inventories and ensure products are received by customers without a hitch. You'll maintain good collaborative relationships with our third-party logistics partners, assist our sales team with global trade show preparation, and work systematically to keep all the logistical cogs turning as they should. If you bring your positive, logical brain to help us, we'll offer an inclusive, world-class team to learn from, the tools you need to do your thing, and the support you need to flourish.
YOU COULD BE THE ONE, IF...
Practicality, logic and reliability are your super-powers. You're that person people come to when they need something done right. And your dedication and patience for a task lets them know you enjoy the process as much as they are thankful for the outcome.  
You're not one to assume. Anything. You don't leap off a rock without knowing exactly what's waiting for you when you hit the water. Maybe you've made that same leap before, maybe you go down to check the water first, maybe you've analysed all those who've done it successfully before you. Whichever way you choose to go, you know just what to expect when it happens.
Hard working, meticulous and highly organised, you can execute a plan with precision and great attention to detail. And repeat your successes over and over. Because repetition and the ""nitty gritty"" might seem dull to some, but it's where you do your best work. You might be a recent graduate, probably have a solid understanding of supply chain, inventory management and logistics, and can definitely work a spreadsheet like nobody's business.
You take ownership of your work, and you do it with pride. Especially when there's a clear goal to strive for. Luckily, at Bellroy we have plenty of goals. We're a growing business and we want someone who'll come in and see that growth as part of their own.
IF YOU WERE HERE LAST WEEK, YOU MIGHT HAVE:
Checked our Amazon inventory levels and calculated replenishment quantities.
Worked through a weekly check on our Amazon listings, making sure product descriptions, features and prices are accurate.
Suggested new ways of managing stock levels within our digital marketplaces.
Kept a close eye on our Fedex movements, and kept our production team up to speed with the status of late shipments.
Checked in with our Logistics Manager, to share your plan for shipping several consignments of trade show gear to Europe in a very tight timescale.
Completed compliance documentation for a new digital marketplace in Japan.
Attended weekly meetings with our transaction team to talk through current projects.
Sat in on one of our Friday afternoon lightning talks, and learnt something new.
THERE ARE SOME QUALITIES YOU MUST POSSESS...
Strong problem-solving and decision-making abilities.
Organised and analytical, with great attention to detail.
Able to extract and transform data from a variety of data sources to process in spreadsheets.
Strong communication and relationship management skills.
Understanding of supply chain, logistics and inventory management (experience in this field a bonus).

With a team of 60 of the best technologists in Data, they work with some of the most innovative technologies and methodologies in this space and have continually lead the way in Australian Data Analytics.

The Culture

Typically the team here GET data, and are active in the community, winning hackathons, kaggle comps and developing interesting Data Visualisations in their spare time. 

They are a very friendly bunch, and organise a fair few staff and client events to either have a drink and a catch up or to review some interesting and new to market technology.

The Opportunity

With 3 new projects signed up for Data Science engagements there are several vacancies for Data Scientists with good experience across R and Machine Learning who love solving client problems. For commercial in confidence reasons we can nit say too much about the projects, although 2 are in Banking, 1 in retail all with a forecasting, Data Mining and Predictive element. As these are perm roles - you will role on to other projects across industries.

The Technology

We expect you to make use of the usual Data Science tool kit (R/Python/Machine Learning - Logistic Regression, K Nearest, etc) and would love you to be familiar with Alteryx, although as you no doubt have a brian like a small planet - are happy to help you develop some skills in this product.


There are heaps of consulting firms in this space, some good, some less so. Whats rare is to find a group that truly innovates, brings new products to market and has such a strong sales capability.

The COO tells me he sees that he is interested in people that would rather be working crafting unique and elegant solutions versus the usual standardised big firm approach. 

If you are the sort of engineer that would rather be hand building Aston Martins, rather than on the production line at Ford, you will fit in fine here.

Times and technology have changed, but this remains our goal. We're growing our data tooling and technology capability and now we're looking for a Data Development Lead to head up the development of our headline product.
Having promoted the former incumbent of the role, we need a hands-on Senior or lead developer to take on the leadership and technical direction of the product, we need someone who is adept at taking business requirements, turning them into technical requirements and making sure the development team is aligned.

New permanent role in Sydney 
  A successful company near CBD have recently signed off a brand new Senior DevOps engineering role. Its an exciting time of growth for them as they grow their customer base.
  Over the past few years, the business have built upon their tech stack, which now looks like;

PHP / LEMP stack / ReactJS / Node / CI / Lambda / API gateway / ElasticSearch / Kibana / StatsD / Conviva / Prometheus 

We are not looking for a Devops engineer from an infra background. We’re looking for someone that will have that background in DevOps space but also experience in the engineering space. That tech could be; Java, Node.JS or Python (but probably Python) – for Lambda functions.
  This role is for a senior level DevOps engineer that will work alongside a great full-stack development team.
  
Responsibilities
  We’re looking for someone that will have that background in DevOps space but also experience in the engineering space. That tech could be; Java, Node.JS or Python (but probably Python) – for Lambda functions.
  You’d be working alongside a Cloud Solutions Architect, helping then build out an automation pipeline at present, as well as a talented LEMP stack PHP engineering team.
  We need someone who will be seeking out information and be a bit of a leader, as its not a hugely defined role. The Stakeholders can be quite hard at times.
  The right person will be someone that knows a lot about the AWS space, instrumentation – for their application stack, so, Elastic Search, metrics, StatsD, time series Databases, point in time, etc. You could be from a maths type background, rather than a statistics background.
  Tasks include; Building dashboards from log files, pre-processing. All in all – a good engineer that knows AWS well.
  Good points – pretty cool project to work on! If you can put up with the lack of direction. Some of the stack could look like;
 $140k+Super
Technology you would be working with;
  Puppet, or Travis CI / Lambda / API Gateway / Cloudfront / Elastic Beanstalk / Python Scripting
  Conviva, Elastic search, Kibana, Statsd, Prometheus, Kubernetes etc
  This role pays in the $140k+Super region, give or take.

Your role
You are deep in the Indian Ocean on a multinational exercise, studying your screen intently for the first signs of a simulated threat. A faint signal is received and the exercise intensifies. Your interpretation of this intelligence, and subsequent actions, will be critical to the safety of your submarine and its crew.
This is the type of scenario you could encounter as a Submarine Acoustic Analyst (Acoustic Warfare Analyst Submariner).
It takes a special kind of resourcefulness to join the Deep Elite, living and working with a close-knit team in the unique environment of a Collins Class submarine. But the rewards are many and varied and the onboard camaraderie is like no other.
Your role will be to operate, supervise and manage your submarine's sonar equipment and acoustic sensors. You'll detect, track and classify noise sources in the ocean and provide Command with tactical recommendations.
Given the limited crew size on submarines, every submariner gains the skills and knowledge to multitask on their vessel and react in the shortest possible time to incidents as they occur. This means you will also learn to handle and maintain small arms, and perform duties such as:
surface lookout
helmsman
first response fire fighter

We're kicking some serious goals and growing rapidly. 
APE Mobile replaces site paperwork by handling form templates, checklists and drawings in a low cost paperless app. It saves a ton of time on construction and engineering sites with zero data entry back in the office.
Our full technology stack includes a Rails/PostgreSQL backend and ASP.NET web services running on AWS, a web client, and a range of mobile clients (iOS, Windows, Android). One of the interesting challenges is that while the app is reasonably consistent in features and functionality across the different platforms, each platform does have it's own flavour and set of technologies.
We are looking for an experienced Test Analyst who can help us move to a much higher level of automated testing. We are hoping to find a problem solver who loves using technology, and who has had the experience in solving some of these problems before. They will work supported by the product management and dev teams, and with the help of another part-time Test Analyst. Further internal and/or external resources may be brought on board if needed.
Duties and Responsibilities:
Improving our QA processes by working with the dev and product management teams to introduce better methodologies and tools that will let us automate the bulk of our testing.
Ensuring we have a repeatable process for testing the products and certifying that they are ready to release.
Performing manual tests when necessary, but the emphasis is on automating wherever possible.
Keeping tests up-to-date and designing new ones as additional features are added to the product.
Using JIRA to document and track issues.
Contributing as a member of the development team in the requirements and design phases of new features.
Skills & Experience: 
Experience with software testing.
Familiarity with Cucumber would be well regarded.
Familiarity with rspec would be nice, as would familiarity with tools or 3rd party services for testing across one or more of the various platforms we support (web, iOS, Android, and Windows).
Good communication skills.
To be respectful, considerate, disciplined, responsible, and honest, and to expect the same from your colleagues.
To have a sense of humour ;-).
Prior experience as a tester or developer with any of the technologies we use would be an advantage (Rails backend, web apps, iOS apps, Windows apps, and/or Android apps).
You need to be able to work in Australia.
Based in the heart of Leederville, we're a small team who work closely.  As a growing company, there will be opportunities for career growth as the team rapidly expands.  Your input will truly matter and your opinions will always be heard.
We use the latest software and tools and we will make sure you are up to speed on those. We've got big plans and would love you to join us on the journey.
We're serious about creating a great, fun workplace but we don't overlook equal opportunity and ethical business practices. We work pretty hard but expect you to have, or at least want, a life outside work. We're building a long-term business and that means sustainable working conditions.
